## 🐛 Bug Fixed: API-404

**Issue**: `GET /api/users/:id` returns 404 for all valid user IDs

**Root Cause**: JavaScript type mismatch - Express params are strings (`"123"`), users array has numeric IDs (`123`), strict equality (`===`) never matches.

**Fix**: Added `parseInt(req.params.id, 10)` on line 19 of `userController.js`

**Result**: 8/8 tests pass, endpoint now works correctly

## 🤖 The 4-Agent Pipeline

```
Bug Research → Research Verifier (EXCELLENT 4.7/5.0) → Bug Planner
    → Bug Implementer (SUCCESS, 8/8 tests) → Security Verifier (0 CRITICAL)
    → Unit Test Generator (8 tests, FIRST ✓)
```

### Agent Results Summary

| Agent | Output | Key Metrics |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Research Verifier** | `verified-research.md` | EXCELLENT (4.7/5.0), all file:line refs verified |
| **Bug Implementer** | `fix-summary.md` | SUCCESS, 1 line changed, 8/8 tests pass |
| **Security Verifier** | `security-report.md` | 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM, 1 LOW |
| **Unit Test Generator** | `test-report.md` + `tests/` | 8 tests generated, FIRST compliant, 8/8 pass |

## 🎯 Skills Created

### 1. Research Quality Measurement
Weighted scoring framework (5 criteria):
- File/Line Reference Accuracy (30%)
- Code Snippet Completeness (25%)
- Root Cause Depth (25%)
- Reproduction Steps Clarity (10%)
- Evidence Quality (10%)

**Quality Levels**: EXCELLENT (4.0-5.0), GOOD (3.0-3.9), ACCEPTABLE (2.0-2.9), POOR (1.0-1.9), INSUFFICIENT (0.0-0.9)

### 2. Unit Tests FIRST
Testing principles applied:
- **F**ast - Run in <300ms
- **I**ndependent - No test dependencies
- **R**epeatable - Same result every time
- **S**elf-validating - Pass/fail via assertions
- **T**imely - Written with implementation

## 🧪 Test Results

**Status**: ✅ 8/8 tests pass

```
PASS  tests/users.test.js
  getUserById
    ✓ returns user for valid ID 123
    ✓ returns user for valid ID 456
    ✓ returns user for valid ID 789
    ✓ returns 404 for non-existent ID 999
    ✓ returns 404 for non-numeric ID "abc"
    ✓ [REGRESSION] string "123" resolves to user (API-404 fix)
  getAllUsers
    ✓ returns all 3 users
    ✓ each user has id, name, and email

Tests: 8 passed, 8 total
Time: 0.287 s
```
